# Introduction

pouchdb-collections is a simple wrapper interface around the popular (PouchDB)[http://pouchdb.com/api.html] API.

Inspired by the [Dreamcode API](http://nobackend.org/dreamcode.html), this library aims at providing a simple, but powerful offline-first solution to data handling.

There is actually no functionality added, that cannot be achieved by using the original framework. But using it, may hopefully come a little bit more natural to you.
